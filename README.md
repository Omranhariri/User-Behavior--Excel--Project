# User-Behavior-Excel-Project

This repository serves as a tool to showcase a personal data analytics project in which I analyze user behavior data between 4 months to find trends.

I used this opportunity to delve deeply with different Excel features, where I cleaned, processed, analyzed, and visualized data using functions, pivot tables, slicers, visuals, etc.

Out of the many insights I found the top 10 service providers, top 10 countries using the application, and much more.
